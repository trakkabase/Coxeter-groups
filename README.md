# Coxeter-groups
Mathematica software to help study Coxeter groups by computing examples and visualisations

This is software I produced as part of my PhD in the department of mathematics at UCL supervised by Dr Larsen Louder and Prof Konstanze Rietsch.

The functionality, at least for now, is based almost entirely on my needs at the time of writing it. It is my intention to augment the functionality as demand requires.

In its current format, there are several bugs, outdated bits of code, and poor explanation of how it works. I will be working to fix these issues over the next few months.
